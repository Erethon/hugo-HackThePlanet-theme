* Hack The Planet Hugo Theme
A simple Hugo theme to scratch my own itch of having a barebones
frontend for my [[https://blog.erethon.com][blog]]. While it's useable, it's missing a lot of
features (pagination, tooltips, thumbnails, proper configuration, etc)
to be considered "production-ready".

Heavily inspired from [[https://drewdevault.com/][Drew DeVault's]] [[https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/drewdevault.com][blog and theme]].

** Configuration
- Setting `disablereferrer` to `true` adds a `meta` tag to instruct the browser
  to not include the referer header in requests.
- Setting `language` to a string sets the language in <html lang=""> for every
  page. Default value is `en`.
- `avataralt` sets the alt text for the avatar image on the sidebar.
