* Hack The Planet Hugo Theme
A simple Hugo theme to scratch my own itch of having a barebones
frontend for my [[https://blog.erethon.com][blog]]. While it's useable, it's missing a lot of
features (pagination, tooltips, thumbnails, proper configuration, etc)
to be considered "production-ready".

Heavily inspired from [[https://drewdevault.com/][Drew DeVault's]] [[https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/drewdevault.com][blog and theme]].
